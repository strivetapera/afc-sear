If one starts to think of the beginning, using his own reasoning, he will have trouble and will possibly supply a humanistic assumption for the real beginning. He would therefore substitute the creature's point of view for the Creator's point of view. Among many scientists there are basic differences of opinion as to the origin of the universe. Evolutionists hold that all living things developed from non-living materials. Creationists believe that all basic categories of nature were brought into being by a supernatural force. It takes as much faith to subscribe to the theory that our complex universe is a mere chance happening as to accept the first verse of the inspired Word which declares, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"",

As we begin our Christian walk, and then continue to grow in His grace, we will want to find out what that plan is, and do our best to follow it. To discover God’s plan for us, we need to communicate with Him. With that thought is mind, this quarter opens with two lessons focusing on prayer. The lessons following those deal with recognizing the call of God and fitting ourselves to be usable in His service.\n\nWe look at the importance of witnessing to others, and the vital necessity of holding on through hard places. The quarter moves on to a series of lessons on choosing and keeping friends who will not hinder our spiritual growth. The concluding thrust is the importance of staying on the alert, ready at any moment for the Lord’s coming.",

These lessons have been structured with the thought of helping you face this challenge head-on by giving you examples of people in the Bible who exemplified characteristics that would be good to pattern after.\n\nWe will be studying about heroes found in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, including our greatest Hero—Jesus. These lessons will cover some of the women in the Bible as well as the men. Elisabeth’s faith, Deborah’s confidence, the self-denial of the widow of Zarephath, and the perseverance of the woman who touched the hem of Jesus’ garment are wonderful examples of feminine heroes we will be learning about.\n\nThe other lessons will cover Zacharias’ faith, the obedience of Joseph (Jesus’ earthly father), John the Baptist’s fearless witnessing, Gideon’s example of courage, Caleb’s determination to wholly follow the Lord, the persecution of Stephen, Ananias’ determination to serve God, and Elisha’s willing service.\n\nOur aim is that with the concluding lesson, which summarizes this quarter on choosing the right kind of heroes, you will have learned which character qualities make someone a real hero.

Similarly, a Christian’s criterion for designating a hero is dramatically different from that of a sinner’s. A person becomes a hero to someone else when a certain quality, ability, or attitude is admired so much that it would be imitated by the admirer.\n\nDuring this course of study we have seen particular qualities exemplified by the lives of twelve of God’s faithful servants. These people can be considered heroes because all Christians desire the same qualities and attributes that their lives portrayed.\n\nIn considering these heroes, we should be challenged to ask ourselves the question: How can I have a greater measure of these Christian qualities? As we assimilate and grow in Christian graces we will be better able to do as the Apostle Paul commanded Timothy, “Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers . . .” (1 Timothy 4:12).",

        "sectionContent": "The purpose of this quarter is to focus on the meaning of complete consecration. Keeping this in mind, we started this quarter with a lesson on the heart, “for out of it are the issues of life.” We continued with various members of the physical body, showing that each member can be consecrated and can be used in the service of the Lord. In order to be totally committed to Christ, we should not only consecrate the parts of our physical body, but also our will, time, money, relationships, and future.\n\nAs you study these lessons, you will find that in many cases they overlap. For instance, the lesson which deals with the tongue relates closely to the lesson on the heart, “for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” We are not suggesting that each part can be consecrated as a segment, or in a certain progression, but rather endeavoring to stress that total commitment to Christ involves all of these aspects.\n\nConsecration begins with salvation when one dedicates his life to God, but total commitment to Him involves day-to-day decisions. You might say that we have taken one lesson on total consecration and divided it into thirteen sections in order to give an in-depth coverage.",

Each retina contains about 130 million cells which connect with the brain to provide instantaneous response. It has been estimated that from the vast panorama presented by our eyes, each eye can send a billion impulses per second to the brain—then our mind chooses significant details.

But Satan is also aware of these good intentions, and after you tell the Lord that your life is totally submitted to Him, Satan will try to cause you to ease up and be less “radical” about all this. You see, Satan knows total commitment to Christ means NO commitment to him, so a war will take place. However, Jesus said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). How far-reaching might the results be if we turn back from a total commitment of our future to the Lord? See Psalm 106:15.\n\nIn concluding this lesson as well as this quarter, it is obvious that we must first decide where we will place Jesus in our lives. Jesus teaches that we should love Him more than anyone or anything—no other relationship can compare with our relationship with Him. We must be willing to say from the depths of our being that He will have preeminence over all others. We must be willing to say, “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (Philippians 1:21). This is the only proper response that we can give God for the great things He has done for us. There is no way to be holy other than by being instruments set apart by God to fulfill His purposes in our world. Holiness is not a “better than you” attitude, but a willingness to let God set you apart for His work. Will you let Him? We do not know what the future holds, but we can know the One who holds the future.",

In order to be totally committed to Christ, we should not only consecrate the parts of our physical body, but also our will, time, money, relationships, and future.\n\nAs you study these lessons, you will find that in many cases they overlap. For instance, the lesson which deals with the tongue relates closely to the lesson on the heart, “for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” We are not suggesting that each part can be consecrated as a segment, or in a certain progression, but rather endeavoring to stress that total commitment to Christ involves all of these aspects.\n\nConsecration begins with salvation when one dedicates his life to God, but total commitment to Him involves day-to-day decisions.

But indicators in God’s Word reveal that the dramatic events happening all around us signal the end time is at hand. In this quarter we will be delving into these events and their meanings in light of prophecy. In the heart of every true believer is the assurance that Jesus Christ will come back to earth and deal with the insurmountable troubles that face this globe, and will establish His dominion here upon earth.\n\nThis quarter revolves around the statements made by a group of ancient Hebrew prophets, whose predictions and statements have the stamp of divine authenticity. Much of what they prophesied is yet to come. But we can have confidence in their predictions. All of their prophecies whose time for fulfillment has already come have been literally fulfilled with 100 percent accuracy. The events detailed by John in the Book of Revelation are interwoven with these earlier prophecies.\n\nThe first lesson focusses on Christ. By establishing the validity of prophetic statements concerning Him, we provide a basis for the remaining lessons in the quarter and for our faith that soon the end-time prophecies will be fulfilled.\n\nThe second lesson moves on to explore prophecies concerning the nation of Israel which have already been fulfilled. The third lesson, Signs of the Times, establishes where we now stand on the time-line of history. Succeeding lessons move on into events prophesied which are yet to come.\n\nThe purpose of this quarter is to help us understand the events we are facing in this world and to recognize the urgency of being ready for the most exciting and glorious event of all—the Rapture of the Church.",

The Sabbath Day is not to be confused with the Lord’s Day. When Jesus arose from the grave on the first day of the week, a new era began—not that the Law was destroyed, but fulfilled. The Lord’s Day, our Sunday, is the day set aside by Christians around the world as a day of rest and of honor to our Lord Jesus Christ. The child of God looks forward to each Lord’s Day, when he can gather with fellow Christians and set aside worldly concerns, enter into the house of God and reap the promised blessings of the Lord.",
